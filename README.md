# MC-W10-CRACK-UI
This is a MCBE crack instead of MCenters. Not tested on windows 11. only works on 1.19.10 or below, because this is patched in 1.19.11.  The download for 1.19.10 is: https://github.com/bernarddesfosse/onix_compatible_appx/releases/download/1.19.10/1.19.10.Appx


This is compatible with clients, just name the client: Client.exe

You will need to run "disable clipSVC.bat" as TrustedInstaller, this makes clipSVC not start until you disable the crack
