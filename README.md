# MC-W10-CRACK-UI
This is a MCBE crack instead of MCenters. Not tested on windows 11. only works on 1.19.10 or below, because this is patched in 1.19.11 and above.  The download for 1.19.10 is: https://github.com/bernarddesfosse/onix_compatible_appx/releases/download/1.19.10/1.19.10.Appx


This is compatible with clients, just name the client: Client.exe

You will need to run "disable clipSVC.bat" as TrustedInstaller, this makes clipSVC not start until you disable the crack

Run "Minecraft Crack.bat" to view the crack UI of MC W10

This has not been tested with the 32bit Or betas/previews
